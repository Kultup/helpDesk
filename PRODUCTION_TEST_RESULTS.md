## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and Notes

### 1. Bundle Size Warning
- **Issue**: Frontend bundle size (571.55 kB) is larger than recommended
- **Impact**: May affect initial load performance
- **Recommendation**: Consider implementing code splitting for better performance
- **Status**: Non-blocking for production deployment

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities
- **Issue**: 13 vulnerabilities in backend dependencies (7 low, 4 moderate, 2 critical)
- **Impact**: Potential security risks
- **Recommendation**: Run `npm audit fix` before production deployment
- **Status**: Should be addressed before production

### 3. Docker Not Available
- **Issue**: Docker/Docker Compose not installed on test environment
- **Impact**: Cannot test containerized deployment
- **Recommendation**: Test Docker deployment on target production environment
- **Status**: Environment-specific limitation
